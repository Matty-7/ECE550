Project Checkpoint 3 - 32x32 Register File

Name: Jingheng Huan

NetID: jh730

This project checkpoint implements a 32-register, 32-bit-wide register file. The register file has:

- Two `read port`s that can read from any two registers simultaneously.
- One `write port` to write data into a specified register.
- 32 registers, where each register is `32 bits wide`.
- `Register 0` is hard-wired to 0, meaning it always reads as 32â€™b0, regardless of any write operation.


Modules

1. regfile

This main module implements the register file that supports reading and writing data from/to the registers.

Inputs:

- clock
- ctrl_writeEnable
- ctrl_reset
- ctrl_writeReg (5 bits)
- ctrl_readRegA, ctrl_readRegB (5 bits)
- data_writeReg (32 bits)

Outputs:

- data_readRegA, data_readRegB: 32-bits

The module uses decoders to select the appropriate register for reading and writing, and tri-state buffers to handle reading.

2. regfile_decoder

This module is a 5-to-32 decoder, which converts a 5-bit input (sel) into a 32-bit output (out), where only one bit is high, corresponding to the selected register.

Inputs:

- sel: A 5-bit register address.

Outputs:

- out: A 32-bit signal where one bit is high, indicating the selected register.

3. regfile_tristate

This module implements 32-bit tri-state buffers. It outputs data_in to data_out only if enable is high; otherwise, it outputs a high-impedance (1'bz).

Inputs:

- data_in: The 32-bit data to be passed through.
- enable: The enable signal for the tri-state buffer.

Outputs:

- data_out: The buffered 32-bit output.

4. register_32

This module implements a 32-bit register using D flip-flops. It stores 32 bits of data and can be cleared or enabled based on control signals.

Inputs:

- d: 32-bit input data.
- clk
- en: Enable signal. 
- clr: Clear signal.

Outputs:

- q: The 32-bit output data stored in the register.

5. dffe_ref

This is a D flip-flop with enable (en) and clear (clr) functionalities. It stores one bit of data (d), and on a positive clock edge, it updates its value if en is high. If clr is high, it resets the stored value to 0.

Inputs:

- d
- clk
- en
- clr

Outputs:

- q: The output data.

6. regfile_tb

This is the testbench module for simulating the register file. It writes and reads back data from each of the 32 registers to validate the functionality.

Features:

- Generates clock and reset signals.
- Writes the value 32'h0000DEAD into each register and checks that it can be read back correctly, except for register 0, which is always 0.
- Tracks and reports any errors during the simulation.

Expected Behavior

- Register 0 always returns 0, regardless of any write operation.
- All other registers store and return the values written to them.
- The testbench will report an error if any register does not behave as expected.
